# Maze Runner

## Requirements 

ncurses C++ library

## Overview

This is a simple maze solving game. The main purpose of it was to learn about the ncurses library, implement the BFS algorithm as pathfinding for an AI, and to refresh my understanding of the adjacency matrix.

## Controls and Gameplay

Use WASD to move the player character. The objective is to reach the end (E). Goblins (G) will kill the player character if they reach them.

## Maps

New maps can be created, simply follow the format of the ones in mazes/. The width and height of the map should be on the first row of the file, and should appear accordingly. The maps must be rectangular.
